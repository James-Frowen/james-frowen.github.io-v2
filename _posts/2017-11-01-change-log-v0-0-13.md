Adding a loading screens when levels are first loaded. There is loading screen when restarting a level since it is much quicker to load than when it is first started.

Increasing the duration the player can run before having to recharge, this is to make running a bit more useful.

### Changes

* Adding loading screen when starting a level
* Increase duration the player can run
* Adding bullet decals
    * slimes when shot there are particle effects instead of decals


### Bug Fixes

* No more delay between when player dies and when the lose screen is shown
