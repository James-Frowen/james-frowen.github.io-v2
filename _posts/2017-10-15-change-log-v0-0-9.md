The updated weapon system only allows the player to hold 2 weapons at a time and requires them to collect more ammo as the level progresses or they will run out.

When the level is lost instead of returning straight to the main menu there a lose screen with an option to restart the level. Additionally the reason for winning or losing is shown on the win and lose screens respectively. There is another objective on the spaceship level to stop the slimes from destroying more than 100 crates. This new objective combined with random spawn location for the player and the slimes means that the player can not just hide in a safe location and slowly destroy the slimes one by one.

The slime AI calculates its next action less frequently but it will recalculate if it completes its action early resulting it less pausing after a slime finished its current action. Spikers that roll over slime blobs will pick them up and drop all of them when they are destroyed.
