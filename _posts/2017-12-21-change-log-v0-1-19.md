I am changing the way I am doing version for Quantum robot. The old system I was releasing stable builds slightly more than once a week. I am not very happy that I am delaying small changes that seem important in order to have more to write in a change log.


In the new system I am planning to use I will push new "indev" version regularly. This build will likely be less stable and will only be the windows version to keep the build time low. I will still be planning to releases the stable version weekly with a change log.

With this change I will be moving the game version to v0-1-x to act as a kind of reset for the version numbers and to make it easier to distinguish between the old and new system.

I am not happy with the length of time it has taken to release this update. Hopefully moving forward I have a better idea of what parts of the game I should be working on in order to create better progress.
