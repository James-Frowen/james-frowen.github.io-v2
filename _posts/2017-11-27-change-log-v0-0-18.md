At this stage of development I am trying to improve the quality and polish without spending too much time on it. I have used the unity asset store to find models and sounds that fit well enough with the game so far.

If the game gains popularity and goes well I will be planning to create new assets to replace the store assets so that the game will stay unique.

### Changes

* Adding new model for Assault Rifle and Pistol
* Adding sounds when firing the Assault Rifle and Pistol
* Adding sound when the slimes throw projectiles
* Adding sound to explosions
* Adding Explosive Force to explosions.
