This should make the game feel less repetitive and faster placed as you may need to dodge attacks from many different enemies at the same time.

I Have also added Occlusion culling to improve performance, this has caused a visual bug where held weapons sometimes disappear but this seems like a good trade off.

### Changes

* Adding Occlusion culling to improve performance
* Adding Blue Slime
    * Moves faster than other slimes
    * Does not split into smaller slimes
* Adding Purple Slime
    * Splits into smaller slimes when they get get to low health
* Adding Orange Slime
    * Shoots fire balls that deal small aoe damage
* Adding Red Slime
    * Shoots explosive balls of gas at the player

### Known Bugs

* Held weapons sometimes disappear, this is caused by Occlusion culling.
