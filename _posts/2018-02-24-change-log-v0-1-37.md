There is now a modification menu that can be accessed by pressing tab. In the menu you can equip different modifications that will give the character different abilities. An example of one of a modification current in the game is the ability to double jump.

### Changes

* Modification menu
    * Menu can be opened and closed by pressing tab
* Some modifications pickups have models
    * Modifications without model will use a default blue cube
* Slimes now drop modification pickups
    * When looking at these pickups popup text is shown on the screen
* Deleting the active profile now disables the back button until a new profile is selected
* Adding LOD to the metal crates

### Bug Fixes

* When creating a new profile the name is now reset
