  <p>   
  I chose to do Physics degree as I have an interest in how the natural work works. Taking this degree also allowed me to improve many skills, including mathematics and problem solving. During my 2nd and 3rd years I started programming using C# and python.
  </p>

  <p>   
  In the second year I did basic programming logic, a small amount of C and learnt about pseudo code. In my third year I did 2 simulation projects. I had to change a c# simulations to test different properties of the system. 
  </p>

  <p>   
  For my final year project I had to create a program to process image of the sun to detect sungrazing comets. I used python for this project. To detect the comets I had to locate groups of pixels that had the correct movement patterns. One challenge was filtering out false positives created by random noise in the images.
