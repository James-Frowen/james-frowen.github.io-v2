  <p>   
  I chose to do Physics degree as I have an interest in how the natural world works. Taking this degree also allowed me to improve many skills, including mathematics and problem solving. During my 2nd and 3rd years I started programming using C# and python.

  <p>   
  For my final year project I had to create a program to process image of the sun to detect sungrazing comets. I used python for this project. To detect the comets I had to locate groups of pixels that had the correct movement patterns. One challenge was filtering out false positives created by random noise in the images.
