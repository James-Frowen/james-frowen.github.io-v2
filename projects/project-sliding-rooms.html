Tidy up
- add "loading" -> "start" button on game scene
- build game for webgl
- upload to itch.io



Abandoned
- NavMesh on moving surfaces buggy

problem with design
- orignal idea was to move from room to room to move up after than rooms move down (into fire)
- problem: rooms move down too fast, but need to move down fast in order to line up doors



Take Away

Can put nav mesh on moving surfaces, and rotated surfaces
World space grid shader
